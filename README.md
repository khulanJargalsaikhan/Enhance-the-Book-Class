# Enhance the Book Class

this project includes 3 .java classes

1. Book class --> blueprint of book
2. BookDB class --> List of book
3. Main

In the main, first we create three objects of book class and add them to the list of books.
Then, we search through matching SKU in BookDB class. If it matches, we will show the corresponding book's title,
author, and description.
